# musicPlayer
Hello, this is my music player and it is still work in progress, now you can load playlists and play them (one you load playlist it will be playing gradually, if you load another it will play only the second one for now) there is also a button "Play All" which will create random order from all playlists and play them in order.
You need to download installer and run it like that.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me on email- jakubpatoky@mail.com
